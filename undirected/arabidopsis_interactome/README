Arabidopsis Interactome, version 1 (AI-1)

Dataset	Description
Arabidopsis protein-protein interactions	All protein-protein interactions from AI-1 and literature databases *
Reference sets	Positive and random reference sets
Space 1 proteins	List of Space 1 proteins


* AI-1 interactions coming from AI-1 MAIN (AI1_M) and the AI-1 REPEAT (AI1_R) are distinguished. Subsets of intreractions coming from the literature (LCI) are highlighted: LCI BINARY (LCI_B) include only interactions binary (direct) interactions; LCI CORE (LCI_C) is a subset of LCI BINARY (LCI_B) including interactions supported by at least two publications or at least two experimental methods. See publication and supplementary material for more information.
