
IMPORTANT: note that these results are using SMNet for undirected
networks (not EstimNetDirected for directed networks) as 
on closer inspection of the paper and supplementary material, the
network is really UNDIRECTED, not directed at all, despite this
information and the GraphML data -- examining the adjacency matrix in
the Excel spreadsheet from the supplementary material, it is
symmetric, the direction of arcs is completely spurious.
